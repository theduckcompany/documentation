# Using NGINX as Reverse Proxy

!!! danger "Getting Support"
    Since [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is notoriously difficult to configure, we unfortunately can't offer you support in case something isn't working. If you have NGINX related issues such as failed uploads or connection errors, we recommend that you [ask the NGINX community for advice](https://www.nginx.com/support/) or try to [use Caddy 2 as a reverse proxy](caddy-2.md), as it is easier to configure and much more convenient to work with overall.

This [tutorial](https://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/linux/web-servers-linux/how-to-configure-nginx-for-websockets/) explains, how to configure NGINX WebSocket connections between your client and backend services.

!!! example
    ```
    http {
      server {
        listen 80 ssl;
        listen [::]:80 ssl;
        server_name example.com;
        client_max_body_size 500M;
    
        # With SSL via Let's Encrypt
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

        location / {
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
    
          proxy_pass http://duckcloud:2342;
    
          proxy_buffering off;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
          
          client_max_body_size 500M;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

At the very least you will need to adapt `server_name` and the `ssl_certificate`/`ssl_certificate_key` paths to match your setup. Please refer to their [official documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) for further details.
